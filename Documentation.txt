OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

Website
-------
1.	Navigate to www.sqlmyway.me
2.	Click the button at the top of the screen to choose an existing .sql file to format. The button may say “Browse” or “Choose File,” depending on your browser.
3.	If you do not have an existing SQL file handy, you may paste or type SQL directly into the textbox. For example, try pasting “selEct Column1 from taBLe1 where Column2 is null”
4.	Click the button labeled “Format SQL”. You should see the formatted SQL code appear in the lower textbox.
5.	Try changing the formatting options on the right of the screen and re-clicking the “Format SQL” button again to see the output change. Selecting “Microsoft Script Generator” will format your script using the SqlScriptGenerator library. Selecting “Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter” will reformat your script using the default options of the opensource library of the same name. More pre-defined formats and customizations are targeted for a future release.
6.	If you are using Internet Explorer, you may click the button labeled “Copy Formatted SQL to Clipboard”. Otherwise, until this functionality is added for all browsers, you can simply select the text in the textbox on the bottom half of the screen and copy it manually.
